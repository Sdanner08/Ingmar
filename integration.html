                                    <p class="text-center lead">Psychedelic Integration Therapy is designed to assist those seeking support in connection with psychedelic experiences. Individuals who have had difficult experiences can benefit from a better understanding of the often-challenging feelings stirred up by psychedelics; while those who have found the use of psychedelics to be a positive method of gaining insight can use supportive therapy to bolster and integrate that knowledge into their daily lives.</p>
                                    <p class="text-center lead">While the use of psychedelic substances remains tightly controlled in the United States, the reality is that many individuals continue to make use of these substances in a variety of settings and contexts, many of them less than optimal.  Despite the potential benefits psychedelics have to offer, there are real risks associated with their unsupervised use. For some users, the effect of psychedelics can make even ordinary, familiar experiences overwhelming, particularly when experienced alone. Other users remain confused or anxious long after their experience is over or have difficulty processing the conflicting thoughts and feelings that such experiences often bring to the surface.</p>        
                                    <p class="text-center lead">Previously, individuals seeking support for such experiences, or simply looking to better understand and make use of the insights, had virtually nowhere to turn. Today, Psychedelic Integration Therapy is tailored to meet people with full engagement and open curiosity; to aid those who seek support in navigating their relationship with these substances.</p>
                                    <p class="text-center lead">Please note that the Psychedelic Integration Therapy is intended for those who have used, are currently using, or intend to use psychedelic substances in their personal lives and outside of a legal setting.  <strong>Under no circumstances will our therapists administer, prescribe or otherwise provide any psychedelic or other controlled substance to a patient during the course of therapy</strong>.  Additionally, our therapy model does not include guiding, supervising or otherwise taking responsibility for a patient during a psychedelic experience. Patients should not plan to attend therapy sessions while under the influence of any psychedelic or any other controlled substance, unless prescribed by a doctor.</p>
